abstract ={Measurements relevant to body fatness are made commonly in clinical settings. However, associations between these measurements and body fatness are poorly known and procedures are needed to facilitate the interpretation of these measurements. Consequently, data from 405 white children and adults aged 6 to 49 yr were used to calculate the correlations between selected anthropometric measurements and estimates of percentage body fat and total body fat. Comparisons among these correlations, for children and adults of each sex, lead to conclusions that the triceps skinfold is the best single indicator of percentage body fat in children and women; weight/stature is the best single indicator of total body fat in girls and adults. In men weight/stature is the best indicator of percentage body fat and in boys the subscapular skinfold is the best indicator of total body fat. Weight/stature can be obtained using a calculator or the nomogram provided. It is recommended that these measures be obtained when there is interest in body fatness and the data compared with percentiles from a nationally representative sample.},

We report simulation studies of two cases where we are testing a single normal versus a two?component normal mixture and a two?component normal mixture versus a three?component normal mixture.

These order selection criteria are used to fit state space models. Models are fitted to a set of monthly time series randomly selected from the series used in the Makridakis competition (1982). All series are composed of real data. The AIC and SIC indicate different model orders in 27\% of the cases. The forecasting accuracy is compared for these cases. The results of this comparison show that it is preferable to apply the SIC, which leads to lower order models for forecasting.},

ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND:Microarray technology is increasingly being applied in biological and medical research to address a wide range of problems, such as the classification of tumors. An important statistical problem associated with tumor classification is the identification of new tumor classes using gene-expression profiles. Two essential aspects of this clustering problem are: to estimate the number of clusters, if any, in a dataset; and to allocate tumor samples to these clusters, and assess the confidence of cluster assignments for individual samples. Here we address the first of these problems.RESULTS:We have developed a new prediction-based resampling method, Clest, to estimate the number of clusters in a dataset. The performance of the new and existing methods were compared using simulated data and gene-expression data from four recently published cancer microarray studies. Clest was generally found to be more accurate and robust than the six existing methods considered in the study.CONCLUSIONS:Focusing on prediction accuracy in conjunction with resampling produces accurate and robust estimates of the number of clusters.},

In particular, a new proof of the consistency of maximum-likelihood estimators is given. The estimated number of components is shown to be at least as large as the true number, for large samples. Also, the large-sample limits of estimators which are constrained to have a fixed finite number of components are identified as distributions minimizing Kullback-Leibler divergence from the true mixing distribution. Estimation of a Poisson mixture distribution is illustrated using the distribution of traffic accidents presented by Simar.},

Leroux (1992) proved, under some assumptions, that the method leads to an estimator which, asymptotically, does not underestimate the number of components a.s.. We prove here the almost sure consistency of the maximum penalized likelihood estimator for an appropriate penalization sequence. The proof uses the locally conic parameterization developed by Dacunha-Castelle and Gassiat (1997). A numerical study of the choice of the penalization term is proposed, as well as a comparison with a moment method.},

abstract ={Motivation: Time-course gene expression data are often measured
to study dynamic biological systems and gene regulatory
networks. To account for time dependency of the gene expression
measurements over time and the noisy nature of the microarray
data, the mixed-effects model using B-splines was introduced.
This paper further explores such mixed-effects model in
analyzing the time-course gene expression data  and in
performing clustering of genes in a mixture model framework.Results: After fitting the mixture model in the framework of the
mixed-effects model using an EM algorithm, we obtained the
smooth mean gene expression curve for each cluster. For each
gene, we obtained the best linear unbiased smooth estimate of
its gene expression trajectory over time, combining data from
that gene and other genes in the same cluster. Simulated data
indicate that the methods can effectively cluster noisy curves
into clusters differing in either the shapes of the curves or
the times  to the peaks of the curves. We  further demonstrate
the proposed method by clustering  the yeast genes based on
their cell cycle gene expression data and the human genes based
on the  temporal transcriptional response of fibroblasts to
serum. Clear periodic patterns and varying times to peaks are
observed for different clusters of the cell-cycle regulated
genes. Results of the analysis of the human fibroblasts data
show seven distinct transcriptional response profiles with
biological relevance. Availability: Matlab programs are available on request from
 the authors.Supplementary Information: http://dna/ucdavis.edu/~hli/bioinforsupp.pdfContact: hli@ucdavis.edu

ABSTRACT = {A method for gene clustering from expression profiles using shape information is presented. The conventional clustering approaches such as K-means assume that genes with similar functions have similar expression levels and hence allocate genes with similar expression levels into the same cluster. However, genes with similar function often exhibit similarity in signal shape even though the expression magnitude can be far apart. Therefore, this investigation studies clustering according to signal shape similarity. This shape information is captured in the form of normalized and time-scaled forward first differences, which then are subject to a variational Bayes clustering plus a non-Bayesian (Silhouette) cluster statistic. The statistic shows an improved ability to identify the correct number of clusters and assign the components of cluster. Based on initial results for both generated test data and Escherichia coli microarray expression data and initial validation of the Escherichia coli results, it is shown that the method has promise in being able to better cluster time-series microarray data according to shape similarity.},

abstract ={Motivation: Microarray technology enables the study of gene expression in large scale. The application of methods for data analysis then allows for grouping genes that show a similar expression profile and that are thus likely to be co-regulated. A relationship among genes at the biological level often presents itself by locally similar and potentially time-shifted patterns in their expression profiles.Results: Here, we propose a new method (CLARITY; Clustering with Local shApe-based similaRITY) for the analysis of microarray time course experiments that uses a local shape-based similarity measure based on Spearman rank correlation. This measure does not require a normalization of the expression data and is comparably robust towards noise. It is also able to detect similar and even time-shifted sub-profiles. To this end, we implemented an approach motivated by the BLAST algorithm for sequence alignment.We used CLARITY to cluster the times series of gene expression data during the mitotic cell cycle of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The obtained clusters were related to the MIPS functional classification to assess their biological significance. We found that several clusters were significantly enriched with genes that share similar or related functions.Contact: kaemper@staff.uni-marburg.de; eyke@mathematik.uni-marburg.deAvailability: Upon request from the authors.},

The objective of this study was to identify and describe developmental trajectories of caries experience in the permanent dentition to age 32. Longitudinal caries data for 955 participants in a longstanding birth cohort study were analyzed by trajectory analysis. Three caries experience trajectories were identified by the SAS macro PROC TRAJ; these were categorized as "high" (~ 15\%), "medium" (~ 43\%), and "low" (~ 42\%) DMFS (Decayed, Missing, and Filled Surfaces). All were relatively linear, although the higher trajectories were more "S-shaped". This effect disappeared following adjustment for the number of unaffected surfaces remaining at each age, suggesting that, among individuals following a similar caries trajectory, caries rate is relatively constant across time.},

abstract ={We consider the problem of determining the structure of clustered data, without prior knowledge of the number of clusters or any other information about their composition. Data are represented by a mixture model in which each component corresponds to a different cluster. Models with varying geometric properties are obtained through Gaussian components with different parametrizations and cross-cluster constraints. Noise and outliers can be modelled by adding a Poisson process component. Partitions are determined by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood, with initial values from agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Models are compared using an approximation to the Bayes factor based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); unlike significance tests, this allows comparison of more than two models at the same time, and removes the restriction that the models compared be nested. The problems of determining the number of clusters and the clustering method are solved simultaneously by choosing the best model. Moreover, the EM result provides a measure of uncertainty about the associated classification of each data point. Examples are given, showing that this approach can give performance that is much better than standard procedures, which often fail to identify groups that are either overlapping or of varying sizes and shapes.},
