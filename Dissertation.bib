Leroux (1992) proved, under some assumptions, that the method leads to an estimator which, asymptotically, does not underestimate the number of components a.s.. We prove here the almost sure consistency of the maximum penalized likelihood estimator for an appropriate penalization sequence. The proof uses the locally conic parameterization developed by Dacunha-Castelle and Gassiat (1997). A numerical study of the choice of the penalization term is proposed, as well as a comparison with a moment method.},

When sample sizes are not large and the number of underlying densities is in question, likelihood ratio tests based on joint maximum likelihood estimation of the mixing parameter, ?, and the parameter of the underlying densities, ?, are problematical. Our approach places a prior distribution on ? and estimates ? by maximizing the likelihood of the data given ? with ? integrated out. Advantages of this approach, computational issues using the EM algorithm and directions for further work are discussed. The technique is applied to two examples.},

ABSTRACT = {A method for gene clustering from expression profiles using shape information is presented. The conventional clustering approaches such as K-means assume that genes with similar functions have similar expression levels and hence allocate genes with similar expression levels into the same cluster. However, genes with similar function often exhibit similarity in signal shape even though the expression magnitude can be far apart. Therefore, this investigation studies clustering according to signal shape similarity. This shape information is captured in the form of normalized and time-scaled forward first differences, which then are subject to a variational Bayes clustering plus a non-Bayesian (Silhouette) cluster statistic. The statistic shows an improved ability to identify the correct number of clusters and assign the components of cluster. Based on initial results for both generated test data and Escherichia coli microarray expression data and initial validation of the Escherichia coli results, it is shown that the method has promise in being able to better cluster time-series microarray data according to shape similarity.},

abstract ={Motivation: Microarray technology enables the study of gene expression in large scale. The application of methods for data analysis then allows for grouping genes that show a similar expression profile and that are thus likely to be co-regulated. A relationship among genes at the biological level often presents itself by locally similar and potentially time-shifted patterns in their expression profiles.Results: Here, we propose a new method (CLARITY; Clustering with Local shApe-based similaRITY) for the analysis of microarray time course experiments that uses a local shape-based similarity measure based on Spearman rank correlation. This measure does not require a normalization of the expression data and is comparably robust towards noise. It is also able to detect similar and even time-shifted sub-profiles. To this end, we implemented an approach motivated by the BLAST algorithm for sequence alignment.We used CLARITY to cluster the times series of gene expression data during the mitotic cell cycle of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The obtained clusters were related to the MIPS functional classification to assess their biological significance. We found that several clusters were significantly enriched with genes that share similar or related functions.Contact: kaemper@staff.uni-marburg.de; eyke@mathematik.uni-marburg.deAvailability: Upon request from the authors.},

The objective of this study was to identify and describe developmental trajectories of caries experience in the permanent dentition to age 32. Longitudinal caries data for 955 participants in a longstanding birth cohort study were analyzed by trajectory analysis. Three caries experience trajectories were identified by the SAS macro PROC TRAJ; these were categorized as "high" (~ 15%), "medium" (~ 43%), and "low" (~ 42%) DMFS (Decayed, Missing, and Filled Surfaces). All were relatively linear, although the higher trajectories were more "S-shaped". This effect disappeared following adjustment for the number of unaffected surfaces remaining at each age, suggesting that, among individuals following a similar caries trajectory, caries rate is relatively constant across time.},

abstract ={We consider the problem of determining the structure of clustered data, without prior knowledge of the number of clusters or any other information about their composition. Data are represented by a mixture model in which each component corresponds to a different cluster. Models with varying geometric properties are obtained through Gaussian components with different parametrizations and cross-cluster constraints. Noise and outliers can be modelled by adding a Poisson process component. Partitions are determined by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood, with initial values from agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Models are compared using an approximation to the Bayes factor based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC); unlike significance tests, this allows comparison of more than two models at the same time, and removes the restriction that the models compared be nested. The problems of determining the number of clusters and the clustering method are solved simultaneously by choosing the best model. Moreover, the EM result provides a measure of uncertainty about the associated classification of each data point. Examples are given, showing that this approach can give performance that is much better than standard procedures, which often fail to identify groups that are either overlapping or of varying sizes and shapes.},
